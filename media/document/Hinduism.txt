Hinduism is Science and a theism at the same time 
How?

The Universe (Brahmand)  consists of 4 things
1. Param atma (Energy) 
2. Param tatva (Matter) 
3. Maha kal (Time ) 
4. Kal (Black space) 

(Today Science says 
Space and Time are not different they are different attributes of 1 thing and Hindus use 1 word "Kal")

1. Param Atma
2. Param tatva 
Both are Param (Supreme)
Hence equal 
Atma = Tatva
Energy = Matter 
E = M
E = MC^2 (After Solar formation) 

Both are Immortal
Both can not be created nor destroyed only translated ( or incarnated) into another form (or body )

Both are Trinity
Energy has trinity aspects 
1. Creation +ve 
2. Preservation =
3. Destruction -ve

Matter has trinity aspects
1. Proton +ve
2. Neutron =
3. Electron -ve 

Hindus personified it as
1. Brahma +ve
2. Vishnu =
3. Shiva -ve

( Anu Anu me Vishnu Vishnu hai 
Kankar Kankar me shankar shankar hai )
 
Since Energy and matter are two 
2 types of worship 
1. Meditation (Yog-Connection  between. atma and Param atma  ) 
2. Idol worshipping ( Param tatva ) 

Why idol worshipping? 
Hindus do the same rituals on the purchase of car bike house TV AC etc which we do before idols 
Bcoz 
A car can be moulded into an Idol of Natraja
But no change in the composition of the proton neutron electron 
So Hindus are not only the idol worshipers but the worshipers of  the entire spread of the Universe as the cosmic form of Lord Krsna(Brahm)
And 
Singularity as Shivling (scroll üëá) 

Functions of Param tatva
1. Proton and neutron are always connected form Nucleous 
Brahma and Vishnu are also always connected through navel cord (Nabhi) 
Nucleous Hindi name is also "Nabhi"
2. Electrons always revolve in its ring
Depicted as
Shiva's dance in the ring of fire 

Functions of Param Atma 
2. Preservation
Vishnu the personification of preservative aspect of the Universe energy 
Or 
Simply
Vishnu the preserver 
We all are manifestions of Lord Vishnu 
1st ideal avatar of Vishnu was Fish üê† 
2nd ideal avatar of Vishnu was Turtle üê¢
Where he came on land 
Now in last 150 years 
Science said the same how life evolved and preservered on Earth 

1. Creation
The universe borns out of nothingness (0) and will merge back to nothingness(0) 

Nothingness is represented by 0 given by AryaBhat 
0 is an ellipsoide shaped Shivling which banged and infinity came into being 
1,0000000000000000......
And 
The Universe 

3. Destruction
Since the universe borns out of nothingness(0= Bigbang ) and will merge back to nothingness(0= Big crunch )

Shivling is the source of creation as well as destruction 

Shivling (0)has 2 functions 
So
2 types of worships
1. Creation (0) -Inner consiousness 
2. Destruction (0) - surrounded by a disc

1. Creation (0)
Pouring water on Shivling and placing shivling near water bodies symbol of cooling down it's energies so that it wont bang

2.Destruction (0)
 Bhasm Arti - raining down of human ashes on shivling shows destruction of human

Now Science says there is a destructible energy Black hole and same way it destroys planets into dust and ultimately collapses into singularity (Shivling)

Now String theory looked into quarks and found out vibrations at different frequencies 
These Vibrations are nothing but Eco of Om(Omkar)
All Trinity principles start with vibration Om 
1. Om Namo Brahma
2. Om Namo Narayanai
3. Om Namah Shivay 
All Hindu prayers start with OM
Omkar(Eco of Om)  represents the start of the physical universe 
So
Param atma + Param tatva + Maha kal + Kal = Universe (Brahm or Brahmand) 

The highest manifestion of Brahm is Para Brahm
Multiverse

Crux
In Vedas 
It's written
Worship both
1. Sambhuti (Matter) 
2. Asambhuti (Energy) 
Otherwise you will go into darkness 


While we  worship Param tatva(Matter) more  not Param atma (Energy) 
So
Do Meditation for 1 hour every day with/without chanting Om
It rejuvenates ur body and soul

All sages did meditation, 
Ravan did meditation ,
Lord Buddha did meditation to empower themselves
______________
Summary
In the beginning there was nothingness(0) which banged 
Came
Adi Para Shakti
Name is self explanatory
"1st energy beyond all  existence"
Then
Vibration of Om(String theory) 
Came
Proton (Brahma) 
Hence 
Brahma is said to be the creator of the material universe 
Then
Trinity(3) to 33 kinds of things which consist of the entire universe 
_________________
There are 2 things 
Worship
1.Param atma (Energy)
2.Param tatva (Matter) 
Now
We all heard worship the Paramatma 
But 
What is param tatva(matter)

Advance defination of matter 
Matter is "a highly concentrated form of energy"
So
There are 2 types of energies 
1. Invisibile energy 
2. Concentrated energy (Matter)
Hence 
We can say that 
Param atma has 2 forms 
1. Formless (Energy)
2. Formed (matter : Condense energy) 
In Short,
Param atma is everywhere in manifested and in unmanifested form.
